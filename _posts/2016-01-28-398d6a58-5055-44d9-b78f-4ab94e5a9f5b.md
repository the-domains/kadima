_Him: Hey, soft lips._

_Me: How do you know that they're soft. You never felt them._

_Him: True. So why don't you let me feel them?_

_Me: \*Blank stare\*_

Ladies, I'm sure you are no stranger to these kind of comments, more often than not from someone you have never met before. And we are expected to be impressed by this attempt of grabbing our attention. 

But hey, this is what flirting is all about. Getting the other party to know that I'm here and I'm interested. As to what happens after, depends on a whole pile of other things we'll get into later.

One of the main questions women and men ask, is 'Is flirting ok?'

\*[Kelly Ann explains flirting][0]\*

How to read the signs:

1\. E-Flirting

You jump on instagram for a late night scroll and find over 20 likes from this one guy. But only your pictures.  Not those with your squad, or of the sunset or even your mom. Just you. Well, that surely has your attention. Especially if his profile picture looks like this.

Now you start to ask all these questions: 'Does he like me?' 'Should we meet up?' Slow down honey boo boo. According to our expert guy panel, the wedding bells aren't ringing yet. It's just a little harmless admiration of your fine self. But if you get a [DM][1]...that's a whole other story.

2.Drunk Flirting

Ladies, we're all guilty of having one too many cocktails and fellas, it may be difficult to tell the difference but here are some clues: giggling even if you tell her the sky is blue, hands resting on the leg just a second too long, ....Yea. Sorry but she probably won't remember you in the morning. Enjoy it while it lasts though.

3\. Mr. Touchy

Guys, correct me if I'm wrong but when you're talking to someone of the other opposite sex, the first thing you do is make sure you guys are sharing oxygen molecules.  You greet her with a hug then your fingers brush against her chin and fall past her shoulder. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying hugs are illegal but we never know what you are thinking anyway. Alright, let me put it this way. If I can feel your arm hairs on my skin, you're too close. If I can smell YOUR perfume on MY clothes, too close my dear. If you're casting on my shadow on my face, please don't try to tell my you're not flirting with me. 

4\. Little Ms. Innocent

I can't talk about flirting and not address this. This sums up my feeling perfectly.

There are lots of people who have no idea how to flirt. Exhibit A is yours truly. Studies should that women are usually accused of flirting when they don't even know it's happening. Remember we are the fairer sex. So gentle, seductive voices and charming gestures are as natural to us as breathing is. Unless a woman spending extra quality time with you and let's her hand linger on your leg a second too longer when she's _sober_, then she's probably just being a nice friend.

At the end of the day, we can't tell you if it's ok to flirt or not. We can only give you clear examples of what flirting is. Have a talk with bae and set up some boundaries so you're both on the same page. And for the singles, just don't do anything you don't want done to you.

Moving Forward,

_Kadima_
