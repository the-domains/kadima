You probably have a lot of questions, like for starters 'What is Kadima? I've never seen this word in the dictionary'.  Not in an English one you have. It's  actually Hebrew  for _forward_. And that's the true essence of what we are about. _Moving __forward._

Team Kadima is a group of talented young minds who are living life and loving it. We have opinions and instead of keeping it to ourselves, we want to share it with you. With hosts Kelly-Ann Henry (Caribbean Soundtrack, GBN Gospel Challenge), and Richie Stanisclaus (GMA's Gospel Act of the Year, Reggae Act of the Year, Gospel Song of the Year) , we tackle the toughest of issues and there is never a dull moment on set.
