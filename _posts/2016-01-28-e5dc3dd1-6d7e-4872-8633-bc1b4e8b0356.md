You probably have a lot of questions, like for starters 'What is Kadima? I've never seen this word in the dictionary'.  Not in an English one you have. It's  actually Hebrew  for _forward_. And that's the true essence of what we are about. _Moving __forward._

Team Kadima is a group of talented young minds who are living life and loving it. We have opinions and instead of keeping it to ourselves, we want to share it with you. With hosts Kelly-Ann Henry (Caribbean Soundtrack, GBN Gospel Challenge), and Richie Stanisclaus (GMA's Gospel Act of the Year, Reggae Act of the Year, Gospel Song of the Year) , we tackle the toughest of social issues. 'Is it okay to flirt?' and 'Who wears the pants in the relationship?' are just some of the topics we dig deep into and say all the things that you are thinking. Because if it's one thing that life has taught us is that the more you talk through your issues, the faster you can _move forward_ and get your life. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89a807a9-da78-40d6-8f4d-93ba4db2cc0e.JPG)

But we don't keep all the fun to ourselves. Every now and then we hit the streets to hear what you have to say. Actually, some of the best opinions we have heard comes from you, our public. So look out for Team Kadima on a TV and street near you.
