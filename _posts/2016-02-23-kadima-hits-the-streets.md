One of our favourite segments of the show is called 'D Street'. In order to prepare, we spend a couple days driving all over the island to find as many opinions as possible on our topic of the week. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/69047599-8274-40d8-8bd3-41677b799874.JPG)

There is really no wrong or right answers. After all, everyone's life is different.

Young or old (and by old I mean wise), male or female, local or foreigner; your opinion _always_ matters to us. Everyone's perspective on life will differ based on their experiences and that a great thing! Yes. It's actually ok to disagree.

And to be honest, the stuff you all come up with is so good, we just wish you could join us in the studio for the entire show.

Thankfully, you guys haven't been shy about your thoughts of relationships, money, family and all the interesting highlights that men and women face everyday! So shout out to all the members of Team Kadima on the streets who have our backs. You put the T in Team and we're grateful.
