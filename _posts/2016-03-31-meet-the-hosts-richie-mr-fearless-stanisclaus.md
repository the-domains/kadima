From the borough of San
Juan Trinidad, Richardson Stanisclaus better known as Richie Mr.Fearless
Stanisclaus for the last 11 years has been committed to doing the work of God.
He has been saved since the age of seven, and has been active in ministry ever
since. From the church choir to being a musician in church to being one of the
Caribbean's top gospel ministers. His ministry in terms of gospel music began
back in 2004 as a saxophonist for Sherwin Gardner and the Flow Masters Family. 

Richie has also played and sung with other Caribbean Gospel artists such as Gitta Dan. Eventually, in 2008 Richie recorded and released his first
pre release album entitled No Demon Parking Zone.

In 2009 Richie faced
one of the most devastating phases of his life. Coming home from work one
evening, Richie was held up at gunpoint in his home town in San Juan Trinidad.
The gunman took his wallet and his phones and after this attempted to shoot him.
But God's favor was upon his life. The gunman pulled the trigger twice but the
gun never went off. Unfortunately that very same week, Richie's home was
robbed. Everything that he worked for even down to his saxophone which was his
favorite instrument was gone. A near death experience and losing everything
that he owned in one week? These were some of the testing that Richie had to
face but with faith and hope God never failed. Richie never gave up hope and
stuck to what he knew best which was God, his ministry and his music. In early
2010 Richie received a phone call from producer J prince to do a track on an
instrumental entitled the "Optimus Riddim." Richie accepted and wrote a song
entitled "Not inna This Time". However Richie did not know that this was a
blessing in disguise. One month later Richie received another phone call from J
Prince informing him that " Not Inna This Time " was going to be placed on Sherwin
Gardner's upcoming turn it up Volume two album. This was just the beginning of
great things to come as Richie's ministry expanded more and more. That very year,
Richie was asked to minister in two countries Grenada and Guyana. Richie also
did singles that year. Love Jesus Christ, never Give Up and Dig Deep just to
name a few. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2faa5395-5b64-4294-a9b3-682d7e84620f.jpg)

In 2010 Richie also launched a Gospel production company called
"Keep It Level Productions". Keep It Level Productions is a faith based non
profit organization whose main focus is taking the gospel to the youth and
streets of Grenada and by greater extent the world. Richie's discography contains Fearless (2011) and P.U.S.H (2014). In 2015 Richie was awarded 3 awards in the First Grenada Music Awards. These award were for Gospel Song Of The Year, Gospel Act Of The Year and Reggae Act Of The Year.

Richie: I thank God for the many blessings
in my life. Today I can truly say that I am a living testimony of God's mercy,
grace and favor. For every trial that I faced, for the good times and the bad I
truly thank God. It has made me stronger spiritually and my walk with Christ
gets beautiful and sweeter everyday. I thank God for my beautiful wife who has
supported me in every aspect of my life, my walk with Christ and my ministry. I
bless and thank God for every soul that has been blessed by my ministry. I look
forward to the upcoming years as I continue to do the work of God. Stay blessed
and Keep it Level To A Higher Level.
Blessings.
