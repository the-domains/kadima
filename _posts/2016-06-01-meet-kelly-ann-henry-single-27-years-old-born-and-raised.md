Meet Kelly-Ann Henry, single, 27 years old, born and raised by Kelly and Queenet Henry in the beautiful community of Mt. Harman, Grand Anse.

She's a no nonsense person with a big heart and razor sharp wit. A travel bug at heart and softee for fluffy, furry friends.

Her first television appearance was as young as eight years, when she was chosen to tell stories with beloved Tanty on 'Story Time'. Remember, 

* _'Crick crack, Monkey break e back, On a rotten pomerac'_

Reading her poem for Tanty was just the beginning of her love for public speaking. During her secondary school education, she developed an interest for the arts. She loves dancing, singing and most definitely enjoys a good debate. In fact, she was an avid member of her school's debate and public speaking team.

It was then that Kelly Ann decided that she wanted to be TV personality.

Soon she was approached by a staff member of CC6 to be the host of Carnvial Rumble, a local show held during the Carnival season. Through this experience, she got the exposure needed to go regional. 

Kelly was eventually called to be the co-host, after some time, the official host of Caribbean Sound Track, a Caribbean music program aired on Tempo Networks. Her other local credits include host of GBN's Gospel Challenge and CC6's City Vibez. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b161a3d4-a9e8-4345-bc62-73a1f53b0a36.jpg)

It was only time that Kelly Ann invested her talent, wisdom and time into her own production 'Kadima'. Kadima is the brain child of Kelly. What started as a dream, became a reality after a few months of careful planning and hard work. Her love for entertainment and passion for all things local, pushed her to create this TV show that so many now enjoy. With the help of Team Kadima, the execution this show has been a success.
