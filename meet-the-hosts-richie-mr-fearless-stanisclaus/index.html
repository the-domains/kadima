<p>In 2009 Richie faced one of the most devastating phases of his life. Coming home from work one evening, Richie was held up at gunpoint in his home town in San Juan Trinidad. The gunman took his wallet and his phones and after this attempted to shoot him. But God’s favor was upon his life. The gunman pulled the trigger twice but the gun never went off. Unfortunately that very same week, Richie’s home was robbed. Everything that he worked for even down to his saxophone which was his favorite instrument was gone. A near death experience and losing everything that he owned in one week? These were some of the testing that Richie had to face but with faith and hope God never failed. Richie never gave up hope and stuck to what he knew best which was God, his ministry and his music. In early 2010 Richie received a phone call from producer J prince to do a track on an instrumental entitled the “Optimus Riddim.” Richie accepted and wrote a song entitled “Not inna This Time”. However Richie did not know that this was a blessing in disguise. One month later Richie received another phone call from J Prince informing him that “ Not Inna This Time “ was going to be placed on Sherwin Gardner’s upcoming turn it up Volume two album. This was just the beginning of great things to come as Richie’s ministry expanded more and more. That very year, Richie was asked to minister in two countries Grenada and Guyana. Richie also did singles that year. Love Jesus Christ, never Give Up and Dig Deep just to name a few. </p><picture>
